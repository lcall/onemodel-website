<h1>One data model; a single, useful repository to store all knowledge.</h1>
</center>
      
<h2>What is onemodel.org?</h2>
     
<p>We are a few programmers with the goal of putting all mankind's knowledge
 into a single, extremely useful system.  (Sounds preposterous, but the
idea is to create the system/structure, and at least have a
flexible personal organizer w/ unlimited theoretical potential.) Imagine being able to do a query
against a database containing anything anyone ever knew or recorded. We have
a requirements list, many design ideas, and the&nbsp; beginnings of some
software.&nbsp;</p>
  The project goal is to model arbitrary knowledge in a systematic, useful 
way, in a highly connected and distributed repository. The approach is to 
reduce knowledge to the most atomic level possible and interconnect all facts, 
as a comprehensive object model connects entities internally. This takes traditional
OO design and allows it to occur at runtime, as a side-effect of data entry
or import. Another way to look at is as "knowledge base creation" without
the advance requirement of building a taxonomy; also it uses objects and
relationships, instead of declarations, for storing data. Obviously this goal
is a long way out and we're starting very small. The dream is for the OneModel
system to someday be as useful for recording and traversing knowledge as
a document authoring too is for creating documents, or as the web is useful 
for traversing documents, and equally useful to genealogists, physicists, 
or business people. It would be wonderful if it someday became useful software 
engineers, for building complex, ad-hoc knowledge systems.  (In another sense, 
it could be viewed as related the MyLifeBits project of Microsoft's Gordon 
Bell, or to LifeStreams, from Yale's David Gelernter, but broader in scope 
and more open than either. I also think of it sometimes as a potential database
back-end for the Semantic Web as a front-end.)<br>
 <br>
 Since all that is a very large task we plan to start by doing a personal 
organizer, but basing it on analysis and design that will allow for the "big 
picture" of handling arbitrary knowledge. The code is to be GPL'ed.<br>

We started discussing this in 2000, but didn't get anywhere for a long time.  The mailing list was here but isn't used any more and it's unknown if it's even still working:  <a href="http://six.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/om-list">six.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/om-list</a>. 
 (The list did provide digest and security features, and has <a
 href="maillist/oldarchives.html">old</a> and <a
 href="http://www.pairlist.net/pipermail/om-list/">new</a> archives.) </p>

 article</a> by David Gelernter. We agree on everything up to his point #38
 or so, where I would replace his emphasis on chronology plus documents as
 organizing principles, with a full model of everything including time, documents,
 and the concepts expressed in the documents. To us, those are just other
elements to be modeled. (Gelernter is still smarter than I am.)</li>
