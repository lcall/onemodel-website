All the content in this project is Copyright (c) Luke A Call, for as far back as it goes,
unless it is a message posting by others, in which case they own it.

For now, this content may only be copied for the purpose of helping to maintain it.  I intend
to do something "good/free" about it, perhaps along the lines of the license for OneModel
source code itself, but haven't had time yet.

So this content may not be used by others for other purposes: except if you think under the golden
rule that I would say "ok" (very likely if you're not trying to harm my efforts for OneModel),
then use it.  Like for personal backups.

See contact information in the OneModel project's source code license if you want to suggest
something else.

We probably need to request copyright assignment on contributions to this as is being done 
for the OM source code.
