How else can the word "literature" be used?  I wasn't using it to mean
anything else, as far as I can remember.  Surely someone somewhere
publishes information on the CES firesides.  I know this, because I get
that publication.  And it indeed is in our stake library, somewhere.  It
was written, and verily it was in a library.  And therefore the information
that you sought was indeed in a library.  Only you didn't know which library.

The only difference between any information that I can think of possibly
and rightfully being in a library or not is in its being written or
published.  To say that OM would only contain information found in a
library is presumptuous indeed.  But honestly, I can't think of any
information that would belong in OM that wouldn't belong in some library
somewhere at some time.

>From what it appears, you've reconstructed my very literal statement that
"nobody needs OM to reiterate what it was told" to include all
non-considered possibilities.  I don't understand how non-considered
possibilities can be viewed as knowledge - but don't disagree with me,
because you're not disagreeing with what I was trying to say, and I
honestly thought that I was quite clear.  If I say, "Bob is my uncle" to
OM, then I don't really need OM to tell me that I am Bob's nephew.  That's
what I was saying.  Now, it surely would be useful to tell OM that Bob is
my uncle and then have OM tell me back that Bob left me a grand inheritance
at his death that I didn't know about.

You're missing my intent.  I don't want the finished product, necessarily.
I'm challenging you to prove that the finished product could theoretically
exist.  My point is that it can't.  My point has been that OM cannot, could
not, and will not with every genius in the world ever be able to create
truth that it was not told.  It must be fed it beforehand by someone,
somewhere.  All that OM can do is provide context searches on sets of
information, and the truth of its results are as questionable as is its
information.  I cannot misinform OM and expect it to produce valid results.
 I don't believe that there exists an independent algorithm that can be
constructed to deduce truth from lies.  In an infinite universe with
infinite possibilities no finite pattern could plausibly be constructed to
model it accurately.  OM can present us with possibilities, possibly
unconsidered, but it cannot produce truth which was unknown beforehand.  It
can produce information, call it knowledge - but not truth.  There is a
difference.

So yes, I certainly would get bored of OM telling me truths that I already
told it, like "Huckleberry Finn is fiction".  But it would be really cool
if it could tell me that the character of Jim in the book is very similar
to the character in some other book.

And as I've been trying to say, a library does this.  Someone has labled a
book "fiction" or "non-fiction" or "biographical" or "romance" or
"childrens".  Without that label - OM could never know the truth of any
given piece of information.  (By this example, and the one I gave
previously, I am *not* attempting to correlate fiction=false,
nonfiction=truth.  I am using them in parallel, as example, but not
equating them.  I am merely showing the necessity of labeling for any model.)

Well, sorry.  I was stating a fact that Huckleberry Finn is in the
fictional section of the library.  I didn't put it there.  If I had my way
a library would be sorted by author only.  Anyway, it seems to me that
you're intentionally misunderstanding what I said about the rudimentary
labeling that a library makes - and then inferring that I support and
uphold its righteousness.  My point was (and is) that the validity of the
events portrayed in Huckleberry Finn could never be determined
independently by OM, and that at some point in time someone would have to
label it.

Did you ever have any of that learning software?  I wrote some for
vocabulary help.  So, I'd enter in all of the words into a file and
correspond them with their definition.  And then the program would
"randomly" pick a definition or word and ask me to reiterate its
corresponding word or definition.  So, if the definition came up "a large,
uncontrollable fire" and I answered "inferno" when the vocabulary list only
knew "conflagration" then I would be declared wrong... and I would forever
be declared wrong until I instructed the mechanism that indeed I wasn't.

I'm trying to keep things simple, which is why I'm making these library and
vocabulary-list comparisons.  And in its simplest form, this is all that
we're having OM do.  Sure, we can make its searching complex, sure we can
ask it really mean questions, but it can only tell truths that it's already
been told.  Sure, it will present us with possibilities that we have
perhaps not considered before, but the fundamental validity of the
information is as good as it gets.

Some of us are 100% certain of many things.  Truth does exist.  Do not
doubt that.  Getting someone to believe that truth is not what OM is about,
I didn't think.  I thought that it was a data analyzer.

....

This is the viewpoint that I'm trying to disagree with (figuring it out
itself).  For example, in geneology I can be presented a list of children
of one of my grandparents - say from a census report.  And lets say that
from a family Bible we get a similar list of children, but it also includes
one more child, (Uncle) Bob, who because of his age, should have been
included on the census report.  If we expect these lists to be complete
lists, then one of them is in error, and without being told the truth, it
is impossible to discern it regardless of the amount of other information.

>    There is _no_ way for OM to find truth, the way you seem to want.
>There.  Is that what you've been waiting to hear?

Yes.  See, you knew what I was after all along.  So why make such a fuss
about libraries and Huckleberry Finn?

Yes.  Exactly what I've been trying to say.  And yes, there is no library
that currently has context searching available.  So?  OM doesn't do context
searching yet either.  And what I'm saying is that I'd like to use a
library in the same way: by showing us similarities and inconsistencies and
allowing the user to delve into it to find truth.  What I'm saying is that
this is the purpose in a library: to present information, literature if you
will, and allow the reader an opportunity to discern the truth of the matter.

That's what I'm saying: we are developing a futuristic library.

Ah, this old trick.  Nah, I won't bother pointing it out any further.

Does it seem that I am disinterested?  I've never spent so much time
writing about something in which I was disinterested.  Of course I'm not
disinterested.  I'm trying to point out, though, that the direction that
this project is heading is flawed.  From many messages I've come to
understand that OM's goal was to discern unstated truth.  I've been asking
for an algorithm because I doubt that the simplest or most complex one
could function.  Let's not go that direction, then... because it's futile.

Yes, I am very disinterested in trying to develop a truth-finding machine.
However, if we're developing a context analyzer, something that can compare
data and give us results - something very much like what I've illustrated
as a "futuristic library" then yes I am interested.  And indeed the first
step in that is to have the data with which to work.

Ooh, wouldn't it be nice to be able to plug into a box all of my
personality and then plug in all of my female friends and their personality
and then be able to plug in circumstance and situation and then ask it,
"Who won't turn me down for a date?"  You know, it would be as often wrong
as it would be right.  But, I believe in a system that could tell me whose
personality is most like mine in some aspect.  Common personalities haven't
gotten me far in the dating arena, so I doubt that such information would
prove useful to me in that regard, but it sure was interesting to learn.

Lee.

Luke,

    Is there some way the list can delete the address of a person who was
already included in a mailing?  For example, you are getting this message
twice, right?  Just like I have been getting all of Lee's letters twice
because he doesn't delete my name from the "to" list when he replies to me.
Can't the OM list delete me, and you in this case, from it's list if it sees
that the same address has been sent the letter?

First, the archetype *is* the class.  If you create a different archetype you
have just created a new class.

Second, any entity may be thought of as a class of a sort, if only of
membership one.  If I add an attribute to "Mark Butler", I have not changed
any properties of living organism, human, or male - I have changed the record
of what is known about me alone.   On the other hand, if I add an attribute to
"human", that automatically affects the interpretation of every instance or
sub class of "human", including "Mark Butler".  If it didn't, it would not be
a correct attribute.

Sub-classes do not need to explicitly repeat any attributes of the parent
classes - after all we may not know anything about a sub class or instance
beyond some sort of name.  "a human" is a valid instance of "human" with
cardinality one and no other known information.  There is no need to waste
space listing attributes we do not know the value of.

Well, I think we should allow users to specify trust levels for different
world views / schemas, and then have the query engine take those levels into
account.  A good query engine would also automatically deprecate the trust
level of each piece of any unresolved inconsistency.

Personally, I do not see any reason to draw a iron-clad distinction between a
node and an internode.  If you treat an internode as a type of node, then a
meta-internode is simply another node that happens to be an internode to an
internode.  And of course, you can then easily add meta-meta-internodes, and
meta^3-internodes, ...
