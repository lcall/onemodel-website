SmartList is secure (well, as secure as e-mail can be - spoofing e-mail is
quite easy) with username and password checking (for the administrator).
You'll want to check out the config files, particularly the accept file.
You can list in the accept file everyone that's allowed to submit posts.
If a random few make it in, well, it's not a big deal.  I've set up a few
mailing lists, some commercial, and some for family, but no outside
problems yet.  In one of the config files you can set it to accept mail
only from those on the dist list.  I think that's called FOREIGN_SUBMIT if
I recall right.

I know about CVS, but I'm not familiar with the inner workings of it.  If
we're going to have a number of programmers working on the project, then I
would suggest that the project be divided modularly, but that work on any
part be left open, each keep his own stash of code around, and that someone
be nominated to "maintain" an authoritative version.  From what I know, I
think CVS is really designed for programming groups larger than this.

Honestly it doesn't matter to me.  Tom and I have served as sounding-boards
for each other's ideas for years (sixteen years) now, and it is true that
we had conversation about this in its early infancy, and it is true that I
wrote MW hoping it to serve Tom in some way (but also as a programming
excersize for me) - in my mind, "so what?".  I'm particularly more fond of
what we called "the honeycomb" or the "bubble chart", which has served me
in organizing qualitative things mentally ever since, and which some of my
missionary companions oohed and ahhed over - but for which I really
couldn't see any practical application.  Anyway, same goes here - as I
mentioned to Tom in person a couple of weeks ago (or was that last week?),
until there's a convincing theory of how to relate two seemingly unrelated
topics (take zoology and mathematics) in some significant fashion, in some
practical fashion, all of this means very little to me outside of an
interesting programming and thinking excersize.

>From what I can see, or from what I have understood, it is the hopes of the
group (in particular my communication is with Tom) that once a ton of
information is put into this database we will begin to see patterns and
from that we'll develop theories.  Honestly, that's good science.  However,
I'm rather uninterested in data entry.  I'm still suffering some
disappointment that the MW program was never really utilized because it
would have provided this first step for me, it would have given me a set of
data to consider.

So anyway, I could realistically be viewed as a critic or antagonist as
much as anything else.  Putting my name somewhere to indicate complete
support of the project may not be 100% accurate for anything more than
historical purposes.

Lee.
