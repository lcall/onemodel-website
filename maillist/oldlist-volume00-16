I am glad to hear some basic agreement from Lee and Tom.  One thing we should
do to keep our semantics correct, however, is to only use the terms "node" and
"internode" in the proper sense that Tom has specified.

I beleive an internode is a strict singular vector relationship between two
proper "nodes" and nothing else.  I have been calling a lot of other entity
relationships "internodes", which is wrong.  From now on, I suggest we call
any arbitrary abstraction an "entity" and use the term "relationship" to refer
to an entity that relates two or more other entities together. 

For data representation purposes, I beleive we can safely say:

A "entity" is any abstraction.
A "relationship" is a kind of "entity"

A "node" is a kind of "entity"
An "internode" is a kind of "relationship" which is a kind of "entity"

The only problem with the word "entity" is that it is hard to say and to type.
Sometimes the words "item" is a useful substitute.

Any comments?

Mark

    This sounds very well thought out and appropriate.  I'll talk to you
more about this at the "meeting" tomorrow.

    I'm not necessarily voting for dinner tomorrow, by the way, so ... we'll
have to see what everybody else wants.
