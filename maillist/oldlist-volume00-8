Wisely so, SmartList strips all of the recipients from the original e-mail
and only reveals the sender and the list (not CCs), so Jared will miss out
on most conversation here unless he subscribes (because Reply-To-All won't
catch a non-present address).

Anyway, Tom, I think that you've done a sufficient job of illustrating the
usefulness (can you pluralize that? properly?  I think uses is the plural,
anyway...) of OM.  If my line of questioning led you to believe that I
thought such an endeavor was without use, then I miscommunicated.

I do not doubt (and even moreso now) the value of having a pool of all
knowledge at one's fingertips.  And I'm not drawing equivalencies, but in
many ways I've viewed OM (well, MW before) as an attempt to reinvent a
library.  Assume, that I had an infinitely large library; assume that its
organization was perfectly consistent; assume that it was completely
cross-referenced in each page of every book and in each index and catalog
(or catalogue for those Brits out there); assume that this library were
electronic; and assume that information was continually dumped into it by
everyone.

Well, essentially this is (what appears to me) to be the goal of OM as far
as being a reservoir of knowedge.  And, on a small scale compared to OM's
goals, and on a much larger scale than currently done by OM, many large
libraries already do (or have the goal to do) what OM's intent is... and
frankly, that's competition, and frankly I think they're doing a mighty
fine job of it now.  And as the books become more and more electronic and
searchable and referenced by the readers, I think they'll outrun OM... at
least as far as I can foresee.

In order for OM to overcome the odds here (as far as being a repository of
knowledge) and beat out the traditional library, then its data gathering
would have to be automated... and in order for that to happen there's got
to be a pattern of gathering established and between having knowledge and
gaining more there is that requisite link of establishing and internalizing
a pattern found among the knowledge already had... and in order to learn
completely new things, the ability to autonomously alter or expand that
known pattern must develop.  (Use model in place of pattern, if you prefer.)

Anyway, the underlying issue here, and the source of my critique is that
there is an assumption being made that the knowledge pattern among one
traditional subject will have any relevance or coherence with the pattern
found among a traditionally completely unrelated subject.  I do not doubt
the value of having my source of information about mathematics being the
same source of information about zoology.  Certainly that's simple to
understand... however, surely you can see that (even though it may be
somewhat archaic) the traditional library already serves this purpose.

In order to serve the purpose of something better than a library, OM must
automate the knowledge acquisition process and significantly improve,
filter, or streamline it.  And for what I know, the way to do that is for a
pattern to be established.  The third learned language is easier than the
second, which was easier than the first because the mind had already
developed similar language patterns which it could follow, and the mind
could observe when new knowledge did not fit that pattern, and then the
pattern was adjusted so that the new knowledge could be retained as part of
that particular language pattern.

And, general (or specific) language models are already developed, and they
could even apply to mathematics (another language) in many ways... but the
crutch of my argument is that the importance of this project lies not in
finding patterns of one language in another, but lies in finding patterns
of language in the Earth's geology and climate.  And frankly any
correlations between them seem to me to be coincidental.

Surely I believe that all knowledge comes from One Source.  Surely I
believe that all knowledge has common ties, but I have my doubts that the
pattern of knowlege among one field of study has any real interpretation
among every other field.  If that makes sense.  So, my question from a week
ago could better be stated, "What has mathematics got to do with zoology?"
(In any useful way.  The fact that Tom studies both isn't very useful.
Studying both may be useful, and surely they have their commonalities, but
to say that the knowledge structure of one mimicks or is remotely similar
to the knowlege structure of another is... presumptuous - surely there's a
hundred more dissimilarities than there are similarities.)

I'm being redundant.

Anyway, if there is no common pattern then there is no value to the pursuit
of OM because it won't serve for much more than a library.

Lee.

I believe I've understood some basics things from Tom & Mark about 
modeling; keep an eye on developments to make sure the concepts you've 
outlined make it into the specs as we go throught this. At what phase do 
you think it would be best to address tracking certainty? Maybe after we 
get the basic scheme and operations working well.

Replies/questions on Tom and Mark's email are embedded below. I've mixed 
quotes from each of them:

 > Relations like "is-a" are often hard-coded because they are very useful.

Tom, can you give a detailed example or two of meta-relations? Sounds 
like a relation is another attribute that the user defines (key 
relationships being predefined); in essense, a relation is another 
entity. The part where I get confused is where they are compared to 
"inodes" and "meta-inodes", so if you could find some examples to 
illustrate all that, it could help clarify this for me.

It sounds like since relationships are entities on their own, they have
types, and each given relationship is an instance of that type, "is-a"
being one example of a relationship type, having many instances where it 
connects specific objects. Is this what you have in mind?

So, when a user creates some form of is-a relationship between entities, 
perhaps  the system can assume it is an
instance of an existing type unless they change the attributes. So, as 
mentioned before, each class is defined by a "type-definer" instance (an 
archetype), which has additional type-specific data defined, such
as constraints, default values, and the type name. These could be
moved, if someone prefers, to a different entity, which then becomes the 
archetype in its place. But
then when you add or remove attributes from a member of that class, does 
that automatically define a new class, modify the existing class (we
could prompt the user for which), or is a new type created only when you 
sub-type it by creating another is-a that points to it as the parent?

Could we handle worldviews and inconsistencies in data by allowing
inconsistent data, but being able to show where the inconsistencies are, 
and allowing a user to choose the data set they prefer (or choose it for 
a given query), given the conflict?

Multiple inheritance as you've described above makes sense to me. But as
to the meta-internodes and queries, detailed examples in layman's terms
would help--describing specific entities, relationships,and
how a search would traverse them. Maybe a handful of dissimilar examples 
would be best. This would communicate it not only to
me, but would make use case fodder for us to build on.

As Mark pointed out earlier, there could be inconsistencies in the
multiple parents. We would need a systematic way to deal with
those--perhaps checking for them at the time multiple parent types are
related to an object, then forcing the user to reconcile or specify
which side overrides the other, before saving the data.

I'll try to get a new proposed list of use cases out, next.

    Does this mean that you can't see Jared's address in this letter?
Certainly it doesn't mean that he didn't receive this letter, right?  I was
using BCCs before.

    Nope, I knew that you knew that there were uses for OM; but when you
said that you wanted an algorithm before you would get too excited about the
project, I thought (and think) you needed a little more motivation to maybe
help us find it.

    I'm sorry I didn't give you a very large database in your mw file
format.  As soon as we have some sort of format that I think we will be
using for a while (or which will at least be _useful_ for a while, even via
subsequent translation into a later version) I will probably start working
on just such a database again.  (Everyone working on the OM project will
probably need such a database for testing.)

    Let me see if I understand yet.  There are data structures, and there
are algorithms to operate on data structures.  Om is potentially one data
structure.  A library is another data structure.  They each potentially
could contain all knowledge relevant to any algorithm.  What can an
algorithm acting on Om do that another algorithm acting on a library can't
do?

    In any library that you've ever heard of, existing or designed, can you
perform a search/query which returns all instances of the following complex
and abstract condition:

    Object A of type C contained object B1 at time T1, and the axiological
value (the practical output or usefulness) of A was N1, with an
epistemological value (certainty or probability) of M1.  Object A contained
object B2 at time T2, and the axiological value of A was then N2 with
certainty M1.  T1 > T2.  N1 < N2.  M1 > 0.5, and M2 > 0.5.  Return all
instances when the difference (growth) between N1 and and N2 was X.

    Let me explain what all that means.  A, B, C, etc. are not given names,
but are defined by their relations to each other.  Given my personal value
system and believe system, I am looking for any instances of when a
component t was added to some object which increased its value.  One example
would be to infer the increase of value of a computer from its increased
output after replacing a small RAM chip with a larger RAM chip.  This query
could be restricted to yield results more relevant to a particular subject,
such as by constraining C with additional relations.

    This is very much a practical, realistic, and conceivable use of OM, but
I've never heard of any library which even attempts such a utility.
Libraries don't intend to model axiology, epistemology, and only to a very
weak and disjointed extent ontology, the three necessary components of
knowledge (according to Em-Veh, and according to a certain author of an old
philosophy text who shares Mark's last name).  A library's purpose is not to
model knowledge or make inferences based on all recorded knowledge.  A
library's purpose is to make available literature, factual and fictional,
and everything in between.  It's the readers job to manually decide how
factual the book is, and how valuable it is, and to make other inferences.

    If a library _will_ do this for me, then fine.  Bonus points for that
library.  (I've been telling people that I might work on digital libraries
when I grow up and get a PhD in cognitive science.)  If the library intends
to do everything that OM is intended to do, then it is either (1) truly
competition, or (2) where I want to market OM.

    (Actually, that's where I would want to market _Informatica_, because
personally, I don't expect that we will have something optimal the first
go-around, especially since I don't think that any of this group is serious
enough to work out the theory first, and start implementation later, perhaps
much later.  Hence this is a testing ground for some ideas.  The rest of the
ideas I've been gathering since 1993, and the ideas I will continue to
gather through this project, I intend to implement in Informatica, which
will be based more strictly on Em-Veh and structured using Mathesis and
mathetical language.  Maybe you guys intend to work out the theory and the
practice simultaneously, which might be fine, too.  We'll have to see.)

    With OM (or Informatica), axiology and epistemology can, to a large
extent, be automatically calculated for you, based on a few descriptors
listed in your personal "worldview".

    Let me explain just one of the problems of my query example, problems
which I think, in most libraries, would be considered to be more cost than
benefit, would not fit their mission statement, and therefore would not be
attempted.

    Cataloguing all objects as being "types" of some other object would be
very silly because every concrete thing (and almost every abstract thing) is
a type of something else, and is usually a type of many things at once.  But
to start a query that is as generic as the one I gave above, every instance
of "type" would have to be considered and compared to the constraints of the
query, otherwise you'd probably miss something.

    Do libraries store metarelational information, such as when one relation
is a type of another?  This goes back to my "make" and "model" example in
another letter.  Is a library going to classify the relation "make", which
relates my car's subclass to it's superclass, as an instance of the
"subtype" relation?  If it didn't, the query in that library could then miss
all instances of when an engine was replaced, and the value of the car went
up.  In this case, C is the make, A is a car, B is an engine.

    More likely, the library will let you search for author, subject, ISBN,
etc.  Oh, speaking of subject searches, libraries should develop this
feature, at least the very least:

    I search for books about mammals.  I expect it to return more books than
I could count, let alone read, because it should give me titles of books
which are about mammals in general, books about dogs, books about cats, and
even books about restaurants which happen to have a small chapter on the
problem of rat infestations.  Do you think libraries do this?  This is not
metarelational.  This is a simple relation.  But I don't think they do even
this much yet.

    The most advanced stuff I've heard about so far (and, I must admit I'm
not studying this stuff much yet, so I really don't know, but ...) is the
attempted use of natural language processing to "read" a book or journal
article and automatically index it, and pick out subject words (and probably
author, title, etc.).  Just subject words.  No relations that I'm aware of.
Just key subject words.  This was one of the important things that the world
famous computational linguistics professor at Brandeis University,
Pustejovski, was doing last time I checked (a year or two ago).  Sort of
pitiful, don't you think.

    I had a class not too long ago called "research methods in biology"
which was held at the Weber State library, and in which I had to write a
research paper on my subject (zoology), and at my fingertips I had some of
the most important and renowned online indexes of primary and secondary
scientific literature available in the world, like MedLine for medical
information, and government indexes, and ... I forget the names.  (I was
obviously not that impressed.)  Do you think any of these indexing services
had a "semantic net" to work with, in finding books on my particular
subject?  Heck no.  They relied on a line or two of descriptor terms which
some guy probably had to type in manually in order for that journal article
appear in at least some of the queries in which it would be relevant, and
hopefully not too many queries in which it was irrelevant.

    These subject searches are by no means complete.  Nor are they concise.
But that's probably another story for another day.  (For example, if there
is not a good semantic net with lots of relations and metarelations, and if
I had specified that C = VW auto, in my thought-experimental query above,
and A = Fox, I might get a whole lot of information on the mammal of the
same name.)

    Right now I'm just talking about subject searches, something that
libraries should be good at.  They are far from doing this well.  How much
longer do we have to wait for a library to perform a massive search on all
my  ancestors who are recorded as having a career in some scientific field,
and any indication of how well they did?

    Personally, I don't think it will be hard to beat any library out there,
by our rules, because we're not playing the same game.  We have different
purposes.

    About patterns, just let me finish mathesis.  Then you'll see a pattern,
a very useful pattern.  A universal pattern among knowledge.

    I'm sure I didn't qute answer your concern.  Please refresh my memory.

ciao,
tomp

In order to serve the purpose of something better than a library, OM must
