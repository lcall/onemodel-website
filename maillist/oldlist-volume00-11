Well, if you say that a relationship is an entity than you can say:

[Read ":" as "isA"]

familial-relationship(x,y)
familial-relationship(x,y) => familial-relationship(y,x)
familial-relationship(a,b) && familial-relationship(b,c) => 
     familial-relationship(a,c) 

parental-relationship(x,y) : familial-relationship(x,y)
father(x,y) : parental-relationship(x,y)
father(x,y) => x.sex = male
mother(x,y) : parental-relationship(x,y)
mather(x,y) => x.sex = female

sibling-relationship(x,y) : familial-relationship(x,y)
father(a,x) && father(a,y) && mother(a,x) && mother(a,y) && (x != y)
=>            sibling-relationship(x,y) 

brother-relationship(x,y) : sibling-relationship(x,y)
brother-relationship(x,y) => x.sex = male.

aunt-uncle-relationship(x,y) : familial-relationship(x,y)
sibling-relationship(a,b) && parental-relationship(b,c) =>
       aunt-uncle-relationship(a,c)

uncle-relationship(x,y) : aunt-uncle-relationship(x,y)
uncle-relationship(x,y) => x.sex = male.

aunt-relationship(x,y) : aunt-uncle-relationship(x,y)
aunt-relationship(x,y) => x.sex = female.


----

Now all of the above is a bunch of relations between relations, expressible in
the same language as one might describe instances of the relations:

father-relationship(TC,MC)
brother-relationship(TC,CC)
mother-relationship(CC,MB)

The above relationships give us everything we need to find out:

Is MC related to MB? [familial-relationship(MC,MB)?  YES ]
Is TC MB's uncle?    [uncle-relationship(TC,MB)? YES ]

What relationship(s) do MC and CC have?

[   familial-relationship(MC,CC)
    familial-relationship(CC,MC)
    aunt-uncle-relationship(CC,MC)
    aunt-relationship(CC,MC)   ]

Simple stuff like this has been done in Prolog on small in-memory databases
for years.  What we need to do is implement a database query engine that can
efficiently perform the same algorithms that Prolog does on millions of
relationships with critical enhancements like schema / world view support,
integrated likelihood of truth meta-attributes, a decent mathematical /
geometrical constraint solver, and some nice front end access tools.

By the way, the *classic* application for a framework like we are talking
about is to build expert systems, e.g. systems that diagnose rare diseases
given combinations of symptoms (MYCIN) or predict the presence of mineral
deposits given geological measurements (PROSPECTOR).

Is the new list concept OK w/ all? (I'm sending to both in case you 
haven't handled the new subscription yet).

I may be answering email only intermittently for a week or two due to 
schedule.

    I got two of these letters, one with the "omlist" signature, and one
without.  Has the subscription/unsubscription/question mechanism changed
too?  Chris Angell wants to join, but hasn't yet.  He assumed that you had
signed him up already.

    Chris, go to the address on the bottom line of  this letter to join.

    OneList@OneModel.Org might have been cuter. ...?  But I'm not
complaining.
