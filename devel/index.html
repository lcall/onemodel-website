<h2><a name="howYouCanHelp"></a>What can you do to help?</h2>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>You can improve this web site.</li>
  <li>Create source code documentation with javadoc and/or doxygen.</li>
  <li>We need to read up on things like Protege and the OKBC toolkit,
and OWL/DAML+OIL and semantic web. Protege might be complementary as an
interface tool if we can be OKBC compliant or something, and OM could
serve as a back-end for the semantic web, but I haven't had much time
to really think either of them over fully.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If you have (or know of) a similar project elsewhere, such that a
pooling of efforts is in order, let us know.</li>
  <li>Help write code for other phases/features as defined in dev't
outline and the requirements. Let's discuss it on the mailing list
first.</li>
  <li>Anything that says "todo" in the code<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>review it for thread-safety, security (including in the
postgresql setup), multiuser issues (use transactions as needed,
volatile keywd, synchronization, etc?)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>for thread-safety, could try the multithreaded junit test
framework, at http://www.mousepushers.com/java.html#mtjunit?</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Suggest how we could get funding so could work on this full-time
(or better yet, fill out the forms for us :)</li>
  <li>If you understand our vision, you could help us design and
implement, especially if you have thought a lot about this sort of
thing or if you
have a software engineering background. Many eyeballs not only fix
bugs;
they also find design flaws. I (Luke speaking) don't have a lot of
experience designing secure systems (though I've read about a
token-based model or
whatever it's called and have used and coded with ACLs quite a bit). I
expect
we will also want to design for distributed systems, and experienced
input
is valued. If you see a need, do it.&nbsp; Major things it needs next
are
support for relationships, basic edit, delete features, a
locally-installable
DB (easier for a non-tech user to install &amp; use &amp; back up than
postgresql),
a good demo dataset, a nicer (cross-platform) installer (that bundles
an
optional JRE?), and a GUI. I'm looking at Protege and the OKBC toolkit
(as
per Mark's suggestion of some time ago). There are many more things to
do,
prominently for integrating/sharing/distributing models.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>I think a milestone for really making this useful will be to
share
data among models (perhaps via the web), like the Web does among
documents--connectedness
(models shared among many people) brings utility that increases
geometrically
with the amount of sharing. So making this into a shared repository (or
perhaps
better, making separate repositories easily linkable), seems important.
License,
distribution, and security models for that shared info could be
interesting.</li>
  <li>Review what we should know/do differently or better for postgres
administration &amp; security etc: &nbsp;If someone would like to help
document
the proper configuration on postgresql, for security etc., contact me
and
I'll show you what I did. (I think I only changed pg_hba.conf from the
default
debian install, and there I only modified lines after "Put your actual
configuration
here". I'm not sure that's the best approach for security. &nbsp;More
thoughts:
limit who can run the app, since anyone can write code to log in as the
"om"
user which can do anything in the DB. On the other hand, is that a
problem
since any user could do that so you need to limit access some other
way?
Or don't give it so much privilege? Or limit accessors at the database
level--better yet--but by what means of authentication?--need to come
up w/ something
there.)&nbsp; Another general thought about security, not well
developed:
at the system level, again, you limit who can access the app. It sort
of
assumes everyone can do anything, at this point. And I'm wondering if
the
way we create secure data would be to have a seaparate oM instance,
even
on a separate (local/personal/organizational?) host which can integrate
w/ any other, over the network, by linking to the hostname (&amp; port
#?)
&amp; the object info. Also, may want to revisit the fact that "om"
logs
in as a user w/ many privileges, and all the code runs as "om", and
om's
password (blank) is in the code. Suggestions welcome.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Whatever you think is needed.</li>

<h2><a name="developerNotes"></a>Developer Notes</h2>
We may want to talk about coding standards sometime.<br>
<br>
The QuantityAttribute was modeled after the Quantity idea from Martin
Fowler's <i>Analysis Patterns</i>. See the files distributed in the
release download, for anything else at this point.<br>
<br>
Why in java? I code on linux, you run on windows, etc. C++ is too much
work for that, for now, given the minimal payoff for this type of app.
Python and
scheme (as in framerd) were also contenders but I started spending too
much
of my limited time learning framerd and re-learning scheme to get very
far
w/ the project. Don't have as good a reason for not using python,
perhaps, though there are fewer python programmers, and I'd like to
maximize others' involvement if possible. Python also is enough slower
it may matter, has slightly
fewer API's into other tools (that's changing fast though). Java can
also
host python or scheme (perhaps except continuations) if desired. Also,
I'm
more productive when I can think in one language all the, time, and
java
is in so many places, from handhelds to big servers, enough OS'es,
phones,
databases, all kinds of toolkits &amp; vendor api's etc., that for now
that's
a win--learn once code anywhere. And it's a very active space for<br>
exploring new software engineering tools in the last few years (like
junit and things like jakarta). Then my small brain can focus on the<br>
ideas instead of the language. You are free to disagree but that's my
rationale for the moment.<br>
<br>
Extreme programming/refactoring/junit: These combined helped me break
some mental logjams. I think the Refactoring principles (book by
Fowler) are very helpful and I hope we use them. Also test first,
"YAGNI" and all. Working code whose design is fluid enough to evolve,
is better than perfected too-slow design cycles. I also use ant to
compile, but that &nbsp;doesn't seem mandatory.<br>
<br>
Why postgresql: it works, is ACID compliant etc., and should be
replaceable with anything that implements the Database interface and<br>
passes the same tests (which may have to be reorganized when we add
another database type).<br>
