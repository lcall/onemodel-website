<center><h1>One data model; a single, useful repository to store all
knowledge.</h1></center>

<h2>What is onemodel.org?</h2>
<p>We are a few programmers with the goal of putting all mankind's
knowledge into a single, extremely useful system. Imagine being able to
do a query against a database containing anything anyone ever knew or
recorded. We have a requirements list, and many design ideas which we
are beginning to organize into a development process. Since that's a
very large task we plan to start by doing a personal organizer, but basing it
on analysis and design that will allow for the "big picture" of
handling arbitrary knowledge. The code will be GPL'ed.
</p>

<h2>Why tell the world when you don't have any working code?</h2>
<p>Sounds lame? We have some good ideas we've developed over the past
several years, but not all the good ones; if you have
expertise and are interested, we'd like your input in the
design process, to do things right the
first time. (In the meantime, we're working on it.)

<h2>Who is onemodel.org?</h2>
<p>This has started out as Luke Call, Thomas Packer, Mark Butler, and a couple of friends. Feel free to join the mailing list, below.

<h2>More Information</h2>
<p>Here some links to things we've written in the past about our
ideas. Some might be slightly old.
<ul>
<li><a href="proj/requir.txt">Our requirements list.</a></li>
<li><a href="papers/km-proposal.html">A proposal</a> Luke posted on
www.brint.com about knowledge management (www.brint.com has some really
interesting material, last time I checked).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gelernter/gelernter_p1.html">Excellent
article</a> by David Gelernter. We agree on everything up to his point
#38 or so, where I would replace his emphasis on chronology plus
documents as organizing principles, with a full model of everything
including time, documents, and the concepts expressed in the
documents. To us, those are just other elements to be
modeled. (Gelernter is still smarter than I am.)</li>

<h2>What can you do to help?</h2>
<p>Some suggestions:
<ul>
<li>You can improve this web site.</li>
<li>If you have (or know of) a similar project elsewhere, such that a pooling of
efforts is in order, let us know.</li>
<li>If you understand our vision, you could help
us design and implement, especially if you have thought a lot
about this sort of thing or if you have
a software engineering background. Many eyeballs not only fix bugs;
they also find design flaws.  I (Luke speaking) don't have a lot of
experience designing secure systems (though I've read about a
token-based model or whatever it's called and have used and coded with
ACLs quite a bit). I expect we will also want to
design for distributed systems, and experienced input is valued. If
you see a need, do it.
