href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gelernter/gelernter_p1.html">Excellent
article</a> by David Gelernter. We agree on everything up to his point
#38 or so, where I would replace his emphasis on chronology plus
documents as organizing principles, with a full model of everything
including time, documents, and the concepts expressed in the
documents. To us, those are just other elements to be
modeled. (Gelernter is still smarter than I am.)</li>

<li>Luke, Tom, Mark are members of <a href="http://www.lds.org">The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (introductory page <a href="http://www.mormon.org">here</a>). This was here because some email asked member to add links. Probably doesn't go on this web site though; maybe if Luke had a blog.</li>
